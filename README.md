# rock-paper-scissors
Project Description: This was a mini-project for my boot camp in which developers were tasked to use JavaScript to attempt to craft an online version of the classic game, "Rock, Paper, Scissors". It was encouraged that students utilize the window.alert, window.confirm, and window.prompt methods alongside basic JavaScript in order to replicate the game, allow players to repeat the game, and log the player statistics of wins, losses, and ties.

Skills Demonstrated in this project:
JavaScript Variable Declaration and Incrementation,
JavaScript Function Construction,
JavaScript Array Construction,
Mathematic Methods within JavaScript,
Window Alert Methods within JavaScript,
If, Else If, and Else Statements,
And/Or Conditional Variables,
Global vs. Local Scope Variable Placement,
